      <p>Oceans are the lifeblood of planet Earth and humankind. They flow over nearly three-quarters of our planet, <br>and hold 97% of the planet's water.
        They produce more than half of the oxygen in the atmosphere,<br>and absorb the most carbon from it.</br><br>
        As our modern world thrives through technology and industrial revolution,the human race is constantly damaging <br>oceanic environments and creatures.
        This webpage was made to raise awareness and change the crisis we are facing together.
        </br>Throughout the years, plastic wastes are increasing, sea levels are rising, and habitats of the oceanic creatures have been destroyed<br>due to the lack of human knowledge on problems concerning the ocean.</p>

      <p class="oil" <strong>Oil Spills</strong> <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pompiere&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
	    <p class="oilP"> Oil and gases that we constantly use are being found under the sea floor. Retrieving these oils through drilling and prospecting can cause serious damage to the ecosystems and animals around. Oil spills are responsible for 12% of oil entering the ocean each year.
  In brief, because there are a lot of tricky steps to get oil from inside the Earth to inside, say, your gas tank. Oil spills can be caused by the accidental or intentional release of any form of petroleum during any point in the oil production process, from drilling, refining, or storing to transporting. Oil can be spilled when a pipeline breaks, ships collide or are grounded (as happened earlier this month along the Great Barrier Reef), underground storage tanks leak, or in the current case, when an oil rig explodes or is damaged.(Live Science)
  Oil can spread very rapidly unless it is quickly contained by a boom (a large floating barrier that can round up and lift the oil out of the water) or other mechanism.

<p class="plastic">Plastic</p><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Hanalei&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <p class="plastics">Plastic pollution poses one of the biggest known threats to the ocean, influencing all ecosystems from beautiful coral reefs to abyssal trenches, eventually accumulating in our own food.
Our plastic waste—chokes the seas, creating vast "garbage patches" such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Plastic touches all of our lives, from the food packaging we buy, to the computers we work with and the cars we drive. But many of the plastics you touch in your daily life are used only once and then thrown away.
So much of this plastic is ending up in the ocean that in just a few years, we might end up with a pound of plastic for every three pounds of fish in the sea. But the future of plastic in our ocean will be determined by the way we handle plastic on land.
Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments. Whether by errant plastic bags or plastic straws winding their way into gutters or large amounts of mismanaged plastic waste streaming from rapidly growing economies, that’s like dumping one New York City garbage truck full of plastic into the ocean every minute of every day for an entire year! And that much plastic is bound to have an impact on ocean ecosystems.

<p class="toxic">Toxic Chemicals</p><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Butcherman&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <p class="toxicP"> “Almost every marine organism, from the tiniest plankton to whales and polar bears, is contaminated with man-made chemicals, such as pesticides and chemicals used in common consumer products.”(panda, 2019) Chemicals can enter into the ocean through land based activities, they can travel for miles through the water, soil, and air from manufacturing/farming places and through ocean currents.
“People once assumed that the ocean was so large that all pollutants would be diluted and dispersed to safe levels. But in reality, they have not disappeared - and some toxic man-made chemicals have even become more concentrated as they have entered the food chain.”(panda, 2019)

<p class="wasteD">Waste Dumps</p><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Righteous&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<p class="wasteP">The most toxic waste material dumped into the ocean includes dredged material, industrial waste, sewage sludge, and radioactive waste. Dredging contributes about 80% of all waste dumped into the ocean, adding up to several million tons of material dumped each year. Rivers, canals, and harbors are dredged to remove silt and sand buildup or to establish new waterways. About 20-22% of dredged material is dumped into the ocean. The remainder is dumped into other waters or landfills and some is used
for development. Similar to sewage runoffs, the fertilizer runoff can cause eutrophication due to the extra nutrients. Flourishing of algal blooms that deplete the water's dissolved oxygen and suffocate other marine life. Eutrophication has caused tons of dead zones all around the world in places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Baltic Sea.

     <p class="globalI">Coral Bleaching</p><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Londrina+Shadow&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
     <p class="globalP"> Warmer water temperatures can result in coral bleaching. When water is too warm, corals will expel the algae living in their tissues causing the coral to turn completely white. This is called coral bleaching. When a coral bleaches, it is not dead. Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to mortality.</p>
  <p class="oceanH">Ocean Heat</p><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Kalam&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <p class="oceanHeat">When sunlight reaches the Earth’s surface, the world’s oceans absorb some of this energy and store it as heat. This heat is initially absorbed at the surface, but some of it eventually spreads to deeper waters. Water has a much higher heat capacity than air, meaning the oceans can absorb large amounts of heat energy with only a slight increase in temperature. The total amount of heat stored by the oceans is called “ocean heat content,” and measurements of water temperature reflect the amount of heat in the water at a particular time and location. Ocean temperature plays an important role in the Earth’s climate system—particularly sea surface temperature because heat from ocean surface waters provides energy for storms and thereby influences weather patterns. Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are trapping more energy from the sun. Because changes in ocean systems occur over centuries, the oceans have not yet warmed as much as the atmosphere, even though they have absorbed more than 90 percent of the Earth’s extra heat since 1955</p>
    <p class="seaSurface">Sea Suarface Temperatures</p><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Akronim&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <p class="seaS">Changes in sea surface temperature can alter marine ecosystems in several ways. For example, variations in ocean temperature can affect what species of plants, animals, and microbes are present in a location, alter migration and breeding patterns, threaten sensitive ocean life such as corals, and change the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms such as “red tide.” Over the long term, increases in sea surface temperature could also reduce the circulation patterns that bring nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters. Changes in reef habitat and nutrient supply could dramatically alter ocean ecosystems and lead to declines in fish populations, which in turn could affect people who depend on fishing for food or jobs.

      <p class="takeInfo">There are many was you can help protect the ocean, one big change would be to limit the amount of plastic you use in your daily life.
        Easy ways to stop using plastic:  switch to metal straws
        if you get takeout food ask them to not give you utensils
        use wooden or metal utensils instead
        reuse plastic bottle </p>
      <p class="recycle">Aside from limiting the amount of plastic you use, you can learn to use the three easy steps that will protect our environment. These three steps are: reduce, reuse, and recycle.</p>
      <p class="recycle">You can also volunteer at local beach cleanups or dontate to the buttons below. </p>
